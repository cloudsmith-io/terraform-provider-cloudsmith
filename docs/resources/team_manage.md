# Team Manage Resource

This resource is used to manage teams in Cloudsmith. It allows you to add, update, and remove team members.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "cloudsmith_manage_team" "example" {

      user = "user1"

    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

> :warning: **Warning**: When running this resource with a **USER API** token (Not applicable to users running this with Service Account API Key) on **newly created teams**, the user will automatically get added to the team causing a `422 error` when specified in the resource as well. We highly advise using a service account for this purpose to avoid the error. Alternatively, the plan needs to be run without the user in the resource and re-added after the first apply happens.
